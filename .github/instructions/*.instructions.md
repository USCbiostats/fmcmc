- This is an R package for running MCMC models.
- The package is lightweight and low on dependencies, so PRs and code edits should avoid adding other packages/dependencies unless strictly necessary or requested by the user.
- When modifying functions that are part of the NAMESPACE (or adding functions that will be part of it), the documentation must be done using `roxygen2` comments. This means that, instead of "manually" updating the `NAMESPACE` file and the `man` folder, the AI should run `Rscript --vanilla -e 'devtools::document()'` (or `Rscript --vanilla -e 'roxygen2::roxygenize()'`.
- The agent should verify that changes work as expected by executing `Rscript --vanilla -e 'devtools::check()'` or `R CMD build . && R CMD check fmcmc_*.tar.gz`.
